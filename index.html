            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>I am Zack Pakin and I am a fourth-year computer science student at UCLA. Throughout my tenure as an undergraduate,
                 I have become vastly interested in the intersection between technology, business, and society. In my free time,
                I enjoy cooking, watching TV, spending time with friends, and traveling whenever possible. During this quarter,
                I hope to create maps and visualizations that suggest places for improvement in public infrastructure, such as
                healthcare accessibility or affordable healthy food. I believe that effective and digestible visualizations help identify problems and suggest first steps towards their resolution.</p>
